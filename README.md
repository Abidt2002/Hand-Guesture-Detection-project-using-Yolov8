# Hand-Guesture-Detection-project-using-Yolov8
This project implements a deep learning pipeline for real-time hand gesture detection using the YOLOv8 object detection framework. The dataset includes 13 hand gesture classes, with annotations provided in CSV format. The annotations were converted to YOLO format, and the model was trained and evaluated in Google Colab using Ultralytics "YOLOv8".
